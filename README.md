# My Neovim Dotfiles

This repository contains my Neovim configuration, which I built after switching from **VSCode** to **Neovim**. Itâ€™s designed to be **minimal**, **modular**, and **highly customizable**, while replicating the key features I loved in VSCode.

---

## **Why I Switched from VSCode to Neovim**

I switched to Neovim for the following reasons:
1. **Performance**: Neovim is faster and lighter, especially for large projects.
2. **Terminal-Centric Workflow**: I wanted to integrate my editor with terminal tools like `lazygit`, `lazydocker`, and `Zellij`.
3. **Customizability**: Neovim allows me to tailor every aspect of my editor to my workflow.
4. **Minimalism**: I wanted to focus on productivity without the bloat of a full IDE.

## **What Are These Dotfiles?**

These dotfiles are my personal Neovim configuration, built on top of [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/). They include:
- **Git Integration**: Using `gitsigns.nvim`, `vim-fugitive`, and `lazygit.nvim`.
- **LSP Support**: Full Language Server Protocol (LSP) support with `nvim-lspconfig` and `mason.nvim`.
- **Theming**: Easy switching between themes like `gruvbox`, `onedark`, and `tokyonight`.
- **File Explorer**: Powered by `telescope.nvim` for fuzzy finding and file navigation.
- **Diagnostics**: Enhanced diagnostics with `trouble.nvim`.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Powered by `nvim-treesitter`.
- **UI Enhancements**: Custom status line with `lualine.nvim` and a minimal starter screen with `mini-starter`.

## **How I Organized and Scaled My Dotfiles**

To keep my configuration clean and maintainable, I organized it into **modular categories**:

```plaintext
lua/
  plugins/
    git/            # Git-related plugins
    lsp/           # LSP and language server configurations
    theme/         # Colorschemes and themes
    diagnostics/   # Diagnostics and error handling
    file_explorer/ # File navigation tools
    syntax/        # Syntax highlighting and parsing
    ui/           # UI enhancements and statusline
```

### **Key Principles**
1. **Modularity**: Each plugin has its own file, making it easy to locate and modify.
2. **Scalability**: Adding new plugins or categories is straightforward.
3. **Readability**: The structure is intuitive and easy to navigate.
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to one plugin donâ€™t affect others, and debugging is easier.

## **How to Use These Dotfiles**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Neovim** (v0.9.5 or higher)
- **Git**
- A terminal emulator (I use [Ghostty](https://github.com/Ghostty))
- [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/) (optional but recommended for terminal multiplexing)

### **Installation**
1. Clone this repository into your `~/.config/nvim` directory:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git ~/.config/nvim
```
2. Install the plugins:

Open Neovim:
```bash
   nvim
```

Run :Lazy sync to install all plugins.

### Keybindings

Here are some keybindings to get started:

| Keybinding | Description |
|------------|------------- |
| <leader>gg | Open LazyGit |
| <leader>fp | Find files with Telescope |
| <leader>fd | Find diagnostics with Trouble |
| <leader>ft | Open file tree |
| <leader>th | Switch themes |

For a full list of keybindings, check the respective plugin files or run `:Telescope keymaps`.

### Customization

#### Themes

Themes are stored in `lua/plugins/theme/`. To switch themes:

1. Open `lua/plugins/theme/init.lua`.
2. Comment out the current theme and uncomment the desired one.
3. Restart Neovim or run `:Lazy sync`.

#### Adding Plugins

To add a new plugin:

1. Create a new file in the appropriate category folder (e.g., lua/plugins/syntax/new_plugin.lua).
2. Add the plugin configuration to the file
3. Reference the file in the category's init.lua.

### Why This Setup Works for Me

This setup strikes the perfect balance between functionality and simplicity. Itâ€™s fast, modular, and tailored to my workflow. By organizing my dotfiles into logical categories, Iâ€™ve made them easy to maintain and scale as my needs evolve.
